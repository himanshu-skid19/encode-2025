 [![Discord](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/xWRaCDBtW4?style=flat)](https://discord.gg/xWRaCDBtW4)

A basic example of using Deepgram's Voice Agent API with OpenAI Azure.

## Getting an API Key

üîë To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

## Documentation

You can learn more about the Deepgram API at [developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs).

## Installation

This is a Python client for interacting with Deepgram's Voice Agent API andd Azure OpenAI Services.

## Instructions

1. Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`. For example, on Ubuntu using a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Set an environment variable with your Deepgram API key:

    ```bash
    export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your-key-here>
    ```
3. Set an environment variable with your Azure OpenAI Services API key:

    ```bash
    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key-here>
    ```

3. Run the client:

    ```bash
    python3 client.py
    ```

4. Start talking into your mic. This client doesn't have echo cancellation; you'll want to use headphones so the agent doesn't hear itself and think it's user speech.
